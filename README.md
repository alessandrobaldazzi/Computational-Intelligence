# Computational-Intelligence
A repo for projects and exercises regarding Polito's Computational Intelligence course.  
It comprends an algorithm to play Hanabi, that tries to play optimally.  
This project is implemented in a quite naive way, I will return to this.  
Until then, feel free to take a look.
